# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started with this, and really demonstrate that I've been putting work in.  I've been at this since May, and while I think I've been really consistent in my work thus far, I want to make sure I'm holding myself accountable.

### Day 2: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.

**Thoughts:** Worked for a while today, and I'm feeling very fortunate that I've got a job that affords me time for coding along with the time I have at home.  Looking forward to starting part time Lambda School program on 9/17/18, and I'm gonna keep going through Eloquent JS in preparation.
