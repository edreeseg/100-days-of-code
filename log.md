# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started with this, and really demonstrate that I've been putting work in.  I've been at this since May, and while I think I've been really consistent in my work thus far, I want to make sure I'm holding myself accountable.

### Day 2: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.

**Thoughts:** Worked for a while today, and I'm feeling very fortunate that I've got a job that affords me time for coding along with the time I have at home.  Looking forward to starting part time Lambda School program on 9/17/18, and I'm gonna keep going through Eloquent JS in preparation.

### Day 3: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today wasn't an easy day for me.  Very tired all day, just struggling a bit with my thoughts and feelings, but I still did what needed to be done.  Worked a lot of the JS-side of things on the todo app.  Worked out a more sustainable way to store the todos, rather than just having them appear on the DOM.  Wasn't able to look at SQL as much as I'd like, but I went over the syntax and language a bit, and hopefully I can work on it some more tomorrow.  Also finished reading Chapter 9 of Eloquent Javascript, and completed the exercises.  I really like using regular expressions, but at the same time, they can be insanely frustrating.

**Thoughts:** Doing well overall, but I hope that my mood improves tomorrow.  Probably did a good 4-6 hours of coding today put together, if not more.  A good amount of that was debugging and trying to figure out why things aren't working, but hey, I guess that's not exactly out of the ordinary!

### Day 4: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not the most productive day today, but I suppose that will happen!  I finished reading Chapter 10 of Eloquent Javascript, but haven't gotten around to finishing the exercises.  I'm going to go through the code from Chapter 7 more thoroughly to make sure I fully comprehend everything that's going on with the robot, as that seems to be a big part of a couple of Chapter 10's exercises.  I also worked more on my todo app, but mainly today was spent trying to figure out a problem the darn thing is causing me.  Again, I suppose that will happen as well.  The important thing is, I sat down and I did it.  Whether I made progress or not, I still put the time in.  And tomorrow, I'll do the same thing.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more optimistic than I was feeling yesterday.  In a better mood.  My wife goes back to work tomorrow, and my kids go back to school on Thursday.  I'll be at work while they're away, but I'm hoping everybody has a great first day!  Excited to learn more, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself.  Likely going to move on to the 11th chapter of Eloquent JS tomorrow, which I'm extremely excited about because I know pretty much nothing about async programming.

### Day 5: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got some stuff done today that I've been meaning to do.  Spent the morning solving a bit of an issue with a project I've been doing with a friend (something got a bit messed up during a merge).  After that I went ahead and finished commenting all of the code in Chapter 7 of Eloquent Javascript, and got cracking on the exercises (though I still haven't finished them).  Also worked just a bit more on the skeleton of a UI I've got going on with the web game project I referenced a few sentences ago.  Probably going to finish out my night by doing a bit of relaxed reading, and trying to turn in early for work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good today.  Always have that ever-nagging feeling that I could be doing more, but I think ignoring that and focusing on what I AM able to do for right now is going to be way more healthy in the long run.

### Day 6: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updating this the morning after the 5th.  Got some good stuff done yesterday!  Spent a good portion of the morning working on the UI for the web game I've mentioned previously.  Put in the ability to handle character potraits for both the ally and enemy team, as well as dynamically change the menu bar when the user enters information.  The UI also now displays "energy" that is handed out to the players and spent to use skills and attacks.  Next will be working on allowing users to spend attacks/commands to the backend, and update the UI on turn change.

**Thoughts:** Had a great time working on the features mentioned above, and I'm excited to get cracking more today.  I think I need to look more at the backend.  I really comprehend what's going on with my JS files, but the Java on the backend is something of a mystery, and I think that knowing what it does and being able to predict its behavior is going to be beneficial to me.

### Day 7: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a good day today!  Spent yesterday studying Chapter 11 of Eloquent Javascript, but didn't end up doing much of my own coding.  Today, I made up for that.  Fixed a bug with my Todo app and added functionality for sorting todos based on priority, name, and date added.  Also set up Cassandra, Maven, and Python on my computer so I could locally communicate with API for the web game.

**Thoughts:** Good day, pretty productive.  This is the first day of my three day weekend.  Looking forward to doing more tomorrow.  Gotta head to sleep now though - feeling pretty tired.

### Day 8: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relaxing day today.  Did some reading for a while and then did some Katas on Code Wars, as well as some clashes on codingame.  Doing continual reps of random problems can be really fun, and I feel like it really helps me get out of my own head as far as what I should be working on, and put my coding skills to the test.  Definitely not something I should 100% focus on, but every now and then I feel it helps stretch those muscles.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying my weekend thus far.  Going back to work on Monday, but until then I want to make good use of my time.  About to go watch some TV with my wife.

### Day 9: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enjoying the last day of my weekend.  Did some more code reps on the websites mentioned yesterday, but also worked more on my webgame.  Got functionality to display icons for each characters' individual abilities on initation of a battle between players.  Probably going to be getting back to reading Eloquent JS more tomorrow, as I'll be in work seated at a desk for most of the day.

**Thoughts:** Consistency is the name of the game.  Today was a rough day for me emotionally, but I'm proud I'm getting through it.  And I'm so grateful to my family for always being there for me.

### Day 10: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  More work on understanding things that I haven't understood up until this point.  Went through the entirety of Free Code Camp's basic Node/Express course, and also started working on MongoDB and fiddling around on mLab.  My goal is that I want to have a basic Mongo DB set up tomorrow to be able to store todos from my todo app, and have full communication between front and back end.  We'll have to see if I'm able to get that far between work on my free time tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**  Super tired today, had a rough day at work, but overall happy with what I was able to learn today.  Looking forward to tomorrow - will probably need more coffee!

### Day 11: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Super late posting this, been really caught up in wanting to code!  Overestimated my fortitude yesterday when it comes to Mongo/Mongoose - been reading through documentation to ensure I fully understand.  I don't want to just breeze through and copy instructions without knowing what I'm doing.  Also been working more on challenges at CodinGame.  I'm a big fan of the challenges that have you figure out what sort of solution you need based on the expected output.  Really works the brain.

**Thoughts:**  Coffee maker was broken - going to have to give myself more time tomorrow.  Start Lambda School this upcoming Monday - kinda nervous, but at the same time excited to learn more.  Trying to reassure that voice in my head that I'm ready for the task.

### Day 12: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of the day doing coding exercises against others on CodinGame.  I've been a fan of that because it's such a change of pace from having my nose in a book, and it's fun to think of clever ways to cut down on code and get it done fast.  Of course, I've gotta recognize when those techniques are in actuality bad practice that I shouldn't make use of.  Also read some of "Think Like a Programmer", though I may have to put that one on the backburner once Lambda Starts.

**Thoughts:**  Got my coffee.  Feeling optimistic.  My wife is sick though, which means that in short order the girls will be sick, and then I'll likely be next.  Pray for me.

### Day 13: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got invited to the repl.it for my Lambda School Javascript course today.  That reminded me that I have not yet finished doing the "auto-graded lessons" Javascript course...thing...that I joined on repl.it a few months back.  So, I sat down and spent my free time at work (probably about 2-3 hours) going through those lessons and finishing them all.  Felt good to finally get that done, though a couple couldn't be submitted because I think there might be a bug in their tests.  Other than that, I read a bit more, and I'm overall just very nervous about getting started with this part time program.  More clash on CodinGame, as well.

**Thoughts:**  Friday, time for my weekend.  I'll probably spend all weekend worrying about getting started with this on Monday.  Likely will spend a lot of the weekend reading more Eloquent JS to prepare, though I did promise my daughters we would finish rolling D&D characters.  Might try to spend a good portion of the time with them, before this program starts and all of my free time goes to that.

### Day 14: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took yesterday off to spend more time with my family. Today I primarily worked on code challenges and continuing to reinforce my understanding of Mongo/Mongoose.  I start my program tomorrow, and I'm pretty excited to get going with it.  A bit apprehensive too, but I'll have to put that to the side, trust the process, and just keep up with my reps. Looking forward to showing exactly what I'm capable of.

**Thoughts:**  Feeling good after prioritizing my family this weekend. Decided that, after months of them asking, I would run a bit of a casual, laid back D&D campaign for my daughters.  Their mother is also getting involved - the party consists of two Tiefling sisters, a Sorcerer and a Wizard, as well as a Wood Elf Druid.  Campign will probably start sometime next week - though they've been informed school's always gotta come first.  It'll be nice to have something to take my mind off coding when I need a bit of a break.

### Day 15: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: First day of Lambda School.  Some basic introductions, getting to know our PM groups within our cohorts as well as our PM. Went over some basics Javascript, namely for loops and functions, basic concepts like that.  I also went over the User Interface I material, which included reviewing semantic HTML and basic CSS styling.  One of my favorite bits was a project that had us take a premade webpage and change it as much as possible with only CSS, which I feel is a great way to demonstrate its potential.  Also did coding exercises on CodinGame.

**Thoughts:**  Off to a good start!  Looking forward to diving into deeper concepts, but I should probably be careful what I wish for and use the time where I'm familiar with the concepts we're reviewing to keep expanding my knowledge!

### Day 16: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Technically did code for the past two days, but I was too tired to post my update for the 18th and so I'm going to consider that a day off, as well. Continued work with Lambda School - continued tinkering with my project for User Interace I, trying to make sure I take every assignment seriously and give it my all.  Mainly just HTML and CSS, but I am still doing JS exercises on the side to stretch those muscles.

**Thoughts:**  Was pretty sick earlier today, but I'm feeling better now.  My wife's birthday is tomorrow, and we did some of the celebrating today.  Feeling optimistic about my progress and the program.

### Day 17: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had Lambda class on formatting with inline-block/box model/basic positioning.  Although I was familiar with each of these, going through it in-detail helped me make sure I really understood things.  I'm going to hit the hay early and work on it a bit more tomorrow.  Did some more coding exercises, just to keep my Javascript as practiced as I can.

**Thoughts:**  Rough day - work has been busy lately, but I'm getting through alright with the help of my family.  It was my beautiful wife's birthday today.  We did some more celebrating, but since we both worked we didn't have as much time as we'd like.

### Day 18: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got started with trying to design the site for our UI1 project, and it was actually more difficult getting going than I expected!  I'd become so accustomed to using Flexbox and Grid that formatting with inline-block, positioning, and floats was actually a bit foreign to me.  I got the hang of it quick though, and was able to get the basic skeleton done while in work.  Really enjoying working off of a design template - although I like imagining things and bringing them to life, it's actually super fun taking someone else's image of a website and figuring out how to make that a reality.

**Thoughts:**  Really enjoyed all of my coding time today, and although it seems like I'm just doing the basics, I feel like it's only making my foundation stronger and stronger.

### Day 19: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had class again today - first Saturday class!  Went over how our website has been going.  I'm pretty much all finished with the basics at this point, but I've been adding on more stuff to meet the stretch goals.  Also going to be trying to do some responsive design for it - never built a site designed to run on desktop, phone, and tablet, so I feel like that's going to be super important!

**Thoughts:**  Worked in my small group as well as with a random partner for a bit of "paired programming" today.  Didn't get to do all that much, but I feel like talking things over and explaining concepts to my peers is helping solidify what I do understand.

### Day 20: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: No class today, but it's my first completely off day in a week, so that's nice.  Worked on the responsive design for the site.  Got the basic skeleton of the phone design all coded up, and at this point it's going to be about trying to make things look nicer with the color palette - looks a bit bland with the black and white right now.  Going to finish up the night trying to get the tablet design down, as well.

**Thoughts:**  Feeling only more confident as time goes on.  I anticipate things getting much more difficult when we get into Javascript, especially React and Redux, but I'm confident I'm up to the task.  I need to succeed for both myself and my family.
