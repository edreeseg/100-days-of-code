# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started with this, and really demonstrate that I've been putting work in.  I've been at this since May, and while I think I've been really consistent in my work thus far, I want to make sure I'm holding myself accountable.
