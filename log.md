# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started with this, and really demonstrate that I've been putting work in.  I've been at this since May, and while I think I've been really consistent in my work thus far, I want to make sure I'm holding myself accountable.

### Day 2: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.

**Thoughts:** Worked for a while today, and I'm feeling very fortunate that I've got a job that affords me time for coding along with the time I have at home.  Looking forward to starting part time Lambda School program on 9/17/18, and I'm gonna keep going through Eloquent JS in preparation.

### Day 3: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today wasn't an easy day for me.  Very tired all day, just struggling a bit with my thoughts and feelings, but I still did what needed to be done.  Worked a lot of the JS-side of things on the todo app.  Worked out a more sustainable way to store the todos, rather than just having them appear on the DOM.  Wasn't able to look at SQL as much as I'd like, but I went over the syntax and language a bit, and hopefully I can work on it some more tomorrow.  Also finished reading Chapter 9 of Eloquent Javascript, and completed the exercises.  I really like using regular expressions, but at the same time, they can be insanely frustrating.

**Thoughts:** Doing well overall, but I hope that my mood improves tomorrow.  Probably did a good 4-6 hours of coding today put together, if not more.  A good amount of that was debugging and trying to figure out why things aren't working, but hey, I guess that's not exactly out of the ordinary!
