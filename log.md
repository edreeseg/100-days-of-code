# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started with this, and really demonstrate that I've been putting work in.  I've been at this since May, and while I think I've been really consistent in my work thus far, I want to make sure I'm holding myself accountable.

### Day 2: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.

**Thoughts:** Worked for a while today, and I'm feeling very fortunate that I've got a job that affords me time for coding along with the time I have at home.  Looking forward to starting part time Lambda School program on 9/17/18, and I'm gonna keep going through Eloquent JS in preparation.

### Day 3: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today wasn't an easy day for me.  Very tired all day, just struggling a bit with my thoughts and feelings, but I still did what needed to be done.  Worked a lot of the JS-side of things on the todo app.  Worked out a more sustainable way to store the todos, rather than just having them appear on the DOM.  Wasn't able to look at SQL as much as I'd like, but I went over the syntax and language a bit, and hopefully I can work on it some more tomorrow.  Also finished reading Chapter 9 of Eloquent Javascript, and completed the exercises.  I really like using regular expressions, but at the same time, they can be insanely frustrating.

**Thoughts:** Doing well overall, but I hope that my mood improves tomorrow.  Probably did a good 4-6 hours of coding today put together, if not more.  A good amount of that was debugging and trying to figure out why things aren't working, but hey, I guess that's not exactly out of the ordinary!

### Day 4: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not the most productive day today, but I suppose that will happen!  I finished reading Chapter 10 of Eloquent Javascript, but haven't gotten around to finishing the exercises.  I'm going to go through the code from Chapter 7 more thoroughly to make sure I fully comprehend everything that's going on with the robot, as that seems to be a big part of a couple of Chapter 10's exercises.  I also worked more on my todo app, but mainly today was spent trying to figure out a problem the darn thing is causing me.  Again, I suppose that will happen as well.  The important thing is, I sat down and I did it.  Whether I made progress or not, I still put the time in.  And tomorrow, I'll do the same thing.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more optimistic than I was feeling yesterday.  In a better mood.  My wife goes back to work tomorrow, and my kids go back to school on Thursday.  I'll be at work while they're away, but I'm hoping everybody has a great first day!  Excited to learn more, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself.  Likely going to move on to the 11th chapter of Eloquent JS tomorrow, which I'm extremely excited about because I know pretty much nothing about async programming.

### Day 5: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got some stuff done today that I've been meaning to do.  Spent the morning solving a bit of an issue with a project I've been doing with a friend (something got a bit messed up during a merge).  After that I went ahead and finished commenting all of the code in Chapter 7 of Eloquent Javascript, and got cracking on the exercises (though I still haven't finished them).  Also worked just a bit more on the skeleton of a UI I've got going on with the web game project I referenced a few sentences ago.  Probably going to finish out my night by doing a bit of relaxed reading, and trying to turn in early for work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good today.  Always have that ever-nagging feeling that I could be doing more, but I think ignoring that and focusing on what I AM able to do for right now is going to be way more healthy in the long run.

### Day 6: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updating this the morning after the 5th.  Got some good stuff done yesterday!  Spent a good portion of the morning working on the UI for the web game I've mentioned previously.  Put in the ability to handle character potraits for both the ally and enemy team, as well as dynamically change the menu bar when the user enters information.  The UI also now displays "energy" that is handed out to the players and spent to use skills and attacks.  Next will be working on allowing users to spend attacks/commands to the backend, and update the UI on turn change.

**Thoughts:** Had a great time working on the features mentioned above, and I'm excited to get cracking more today.  I think I need to look more at the backend.  I really comprehend what's going on with my JS files, but the Java on the backend is something of a mystery, and I think that knowing what it does and being able to predict its behavior is going to be beneficial to me.

### Day 7: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a good day today!  Spent yesterday studying Chapter 11 of Eloquent Javascript, but didn't end up doing much of my own coding.  Today, I made up for that.  Fixed a bug with my Todo app and added functionality for sorting todos based on priority, name, and date added.  Also set up Cassandra, Maven, and Python on my computer so I could locally communicate with API for the web game.

**Thoughts:** Good day, pretty productive.  This is the first day of my three day weekend.  Looking forward to doing more tomorrow.  Gotta head to sleep now though - feeling pretty tired.
