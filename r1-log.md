# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Ed Reeseg]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.  See main log for details/links to work.

### R1D2
Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.
