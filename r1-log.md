# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Ed Reeseg]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.  See main log for details/links to work.

### R1D2
Finished work and exercises on Chapter 8 of Eloquent Javascript.  Planning to go back through Chapter 7 and make sure I fully understand all of the example code.  Continued working on my todo app - made the UI a bit more presentable, and added functionality to dictate priority of a todo (low, medium, high).  Planning on adding ability to sort todos.  Plan for tomorrow is more todo work and SQL.

### R1D3
Today wasn't an easy day for me.  Very tired all day, just struggling a bit with my thoughts and feelings, but I still did what needed to be done.  Worked a lot of the JS-side of things on the todo app.  Worked out a more sustainable way to store the todos, rather than just having them appear on the DOM.  Wasn't able to look at SQL as much as I'd like, but I went over the syntax and language a bit, and hopefully I can work on it some more tomorrow.  Also finished reading Chapter 9 of Eloquent Javascript, and completed the exercises.  I really like using regular expressions, but at the same time, they can be insanely frustrating.

### R1D4

Not the most productive day today, but I suppose that will happen!  I finished reading Chapter 10 of Eloquent Javascript, but haven't gotten around to finishing the exercises.  I'm going to go through the code from Chapter 7 more thoroughly to make sure I fully comprehend everything that's going on with the robot, as that seems to be a big part of a couple of Chapter 10's exercises.  I also worked more on my todo app, but mainly today was spent trying to figure out a problem the darn thing is causing me.  Again, I suppose that will happen as well.  The important thing is, I sat down and I did it.  Whether I made progress or not, I still put the time in.  And tomorrow, I'll do the same thing.

### R1D5

Got some stuff done today that I've been meaning to do.  Spent the morning solving a bit of an issue with a project I've been doing with a friend (something got a bit messed up during a merge).  After that I went ahead and finished commenting all of the code in Chapter 7 of Eloquent Javascript, and got cracking on the exercises (though I still haven't finished them).  Also worked just a bit more on the skeleton of a UI I've got going on with the web game project I referenced a few sentences ago.  Probably going to finish out my night by doing a bit of relaxed reading, and trying to turn in early for work.

### R1D6

Updating this the morning after the 5th.  Got some good stuff done yesterday!  Spent a good portion of the morning working on the UI for the web game I've mentioned previously.  Put in the ability to handle character potraits for both the ally and enemy team, as well as dynamically change the menu bar when the user enters information.  The UI also now displays "energy" that is handed out to the players and spent to use skills and attacks.  Next will be working on allowing users to spend attacks/commands to the backend, and update the UI on turn change.
