## Log

### R1D1 
Tuned into Byteconf and checked out some of the speakers - gonna slowly watch the rest over the next week or so.  Continued working my way through Eloquent JavaScript - worked a bit on commenting/understanding the code from Chapter 7.  Wasn't sure if studying from a textbook and doing exercises was considered "coding" for the purposes of this, so I went ahead and threw together the basic structure of a Todo App that I want to put some time into over the next few days.  Might continue to learn the basics of SQL for the rest of tonight, though I may wait until tomorrow for that.  See main log for details/links to work.
